A local, containerized MVP web app demonstrating cannabis seed-to-sale traceability concepts with a simple Apple-style UI.

# üß© Cannabis Traceability MVP ‚Äì App Stack

This folder contains multiple frontends for local development via Docker or direct node.

## üöÄ Quick Start (Docker)

```bash
docker compose up --build
```

Services and ports:
- Welcome Frontend: http://localhost:9000 (HMR 24678)
- Regulator Frontend: http://localhost:9001 (HMR 24679)
- Auditor Frontend: http://localhost:9002 (HMR 24680)
- Farmer Frontend: http://localhost:9003 (container port 9000; HMR 24682)
 - Retail Frontend: http://localhost:9004 (HMR 24683)
 - Laboratory Frontend: http://localhost:9005 (HMR 24681)

Notes:

- HMR ports: 24678 (welcome), 24679 (regulator), 24680 (auditor/retail), 24681 (lab), 24682 (farmer).

## üß™ Running Locally (without Docker)

No backend or database is required. All data is mocked in-memory within each frontend for demo purposes.

Frontends (in separate terminals):
```bash
cd welcome-frontend && npm install && npm run dev    # :9000
cd regulator-frontend && npm install && npm run dev  # :9001
cd auditor-frontend && npm install && npm run dev    # :9002
cd farmer-frontend && npm install && npm run dev     # :9003
cd retail-frontend && npm install && npm run dev     # :9004
cd laboratory-frontend && npm install && npm run dev # :9005
```

## üõçÔ∏è What‚Äôs new (Retail Frontend)

- POS
	- Simplified thermal-style receipt that prints via an in-page overlay (no extra windows/tabs). Uses window.print with afterprint cleanup.
	- Product grid constrained to exactly 3 visible rows; additional items scroll within the grid.
	- Customer DOB input enforces a maximum date of ‚Äútoday minus 18 years.‚Äù
	- Local image assets by SKU under `retail-frontend/public/images/products` with graceful fallback.
	- Inventory page now uses the same local SKU-based images for consistency.
	- Minor UI polish and consistent page header/title icon.

## ‚ú® What‚Äôs new (Regulator Frontend)

- Calendar
	- Farmer-only events removed (harvest, transplant, drying checks).
	- ‚ÄúSync‚Äù and ‚ÄúNew‚Äù buttons restyled to match the compact ‚ÄúToday‚Äù button.
	- New events must be assigned to an operator; add/edit modals include a required Operator selector.
- Operators
	- ‚ÄúSchedule inspection‚Äù and ‚ÄúNotice of deficiency‚Äù now open realistic modals with structured inputs and mock persistence.
	- Email hints removed from CTA labels for a cleaner, professional look.
- Reports
	- Buttons restyled to compact bordered style; snapshot creation shows a short processing delay then downloads an empty file.
	- Automated reports consolidated, with per-item downloads (csv/pdf) using mock blobs.
- Notifications
	- Redesigned dropdown: grouped by category with titles, timestamps, operator chips, unread indicators, and quick actions.
	- Realistic mock notifications synthesized (compliance, inspections, licensing, integrity, reports, capacity).
- Profile
	- Removed temporary API token section.
	- Cleaned ‚Äú(mock)‚Äù from subtitles.
 - Page headers & icons
	- Standardized all page titles to a consistent H1 style (text-2xl font-semibold).
	- Ensured page-level titles include the same icon used in the navbar.
	- Integrity icon updated to a blockchain-like symbol (Boxes) everywhere.
	- Calendar icon color standardized to emerald in page titles.

## üåæ What‚Äôs new (Farmer Frontend)

- Production
	- Quick actions use a right-side drawer for a focused workflow.
	- Added realistic actions: Germination, Transplant, Flip to flower, Harvest, Start drying, End drying, Lab submission, Packaging, Transfer/Manifest.
	- Forms use data-driven selects populated from current plants/harvests where possible (strain, batch, rooms), plus sensible mocked lists (labs, facilities, drivers, label templates).
	- Stage badges and KPIs for plants, harvests, and active batches.
- Inventory (new)
	- New page and navbar item next to Production with a realistic, filterable inventory view.
	- Covers Flower, Trim, Pre-rolls, Oil, Packaging, Nutrients, Supplies with large‚Äëfarm scale mock data.
	- KPIs for distinct items, total weight, and unit count.
	- Drawer-based ‚ÄúAdd item‚Äù action with a structured form (SKU, Name, Category, UoM, Quantity, Status, Strain/Batch, Facility/Location).
 - Misc
	- Debug data route removed from the farmer app in the MVP build path to avoid dev-only errors.
 - Page headers & icons
	- Standardized all page titles to the same H1 style (text-2xl font-semibold).
	- Every page title now uses the exact same icon as its navbar entry (Production ‚Üí Workflow, Inventory ‚Üí Package, Lifecycle ‚Üí ShieldCheck, Reports ‚Üí FileText, Calendar ‚Üí Calendar).
	- Calendar title icon uses emerald tone for visual consistency.

## üõ°Ô∏è What‚Äôs new (Auditor Frontend)

- Page headers & icons
	- Added/standardized page-level titles with icons to match the navbar (Lifecycle, Integrity, Reports, Calendar).
	- Integrity icon updated to blockchain-like (Boxes) in navbar and page headers.
	- All page titles use the consistent H1 style (text-2xl font-semibold).
- Reports
	- Snapshot and automated report lists styled consistently with Regulator.

- Navigation
	- Removed Licensing, Operators, Lifecycle, and Integrity from the lab navbar and routes (redirects to Dashboard if visited).
	- Added a dedicated Testing page for intake ‚Üí testing ‚Üí review ‚Üí COA workflow.
- Authentication & Profile
	- Default role set to Lab in the lab app; login screen defaults to Username ‚ÄúLaboratory‚Äù.
	- 2FA seed changed to LAB-DEMO (code displayed on the phone mock).
	- Profile shows lab-relevant modules and address.
- Dashboard
	- Reworked to lab KPIs (Samples in queue, TAT, COA status) and panels (Potency, Pesticides, Microbials, Heavy metals).
	- Alerts section simplified to lab-relevant notices.
- Calendar
	- Shows only lab-created events; removed cultivation lifecycle overlays.
	- Quick-add menu uses lab items: Sample pickup, Testing, COA due, Instrument calibration, Client meeting.
- Reports
	- Replaced with lab-focused groups: COA & Results, Turnaround Time, Operational.
- Notifications
	- Adjusted categories and entries for Intake, Testing, COA, Schedule, and Reports.
- Typography
	- Standardized page titles to the same H1 style across Lab pages.

## üì¶ One-file Docker Desktop Release

Goal: let someone import one artifact into Docker Desktop and run the MVP without building locally.

Approach options:

1) Save images after building locally (simple)
	 - Build once: `docker compose build`
	 - Export all relevant images into a single tar:
		 - macOS/Linux: `docker image save $(docker compose config --images) -o cannabis-mvp-images.tar`
	 - Share `cannabis-mvp-images.tar`.
	 - User imports in Docker Desktop: Images > Load (or `docker image load -i cannabis-mvp-images.tar`).
	 - Then run: `docker compose up` (no rebuild needed).

2) Pre-bake dev servers into static images and provide a Compose + images pack (recommended for releases)
	 - After building, create a `release` folder with:
		 - `docker-compose.yml`
		 - `images.tar` (from step 1)
	 - User downloads the folder as a single archive and:

		## ÔøΩ One‚Äëfile Docker Desktop release

		Download a single bundle from GitHub Releases and run the MVP without building.

		Option A ‚Äî Use the prebuilt bundle (recommended)

		1) Download cannabis-mvp-bundle.zip from the latest Release:
		   https://github.com/RenewEdge-Solutions/x2s-mvp/releases/latest
		2) In Docker Desktop:
			- Images > Load > pick cannabis-mvp-images.tar from the zip
			- Containers > Create from compose > pick compose.yml
			- Run

		Option B ‚Äî Build locally and create the bundle yourself

		```bash
		docker compose build
		docker image save $(docker compose config --images) -o cannabis-mvp-images.tar
		```

		- Import via Docker Desktop (Images ‚Üí Load) or CLI: `docker image load -i cannabis-mvp-images.tar`.
		- Then run: `docker compose up`.

		Helper script (local): `cannabis-traceability-mvp/tools/release/export-images.sh` builds, exports, and zips a ready‚Äëto‚Äëshare bundle.

		Optional helper script (if present): `tools/release/export-images.sh` performs the build + export.

		## üß™ Run locally (without Docker)

		All frontends run standalone with mocked data:

		```bash
		cd welcome-frontend && npm install && npm run dev    # :9000
